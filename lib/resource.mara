Resource.mara
=============

The `Resource` trait is used to manage sharable or external resources like files, sockets, and mutexes. The Resource trait is special in that the compiler will automatically call the `release` method when an object adopting Resource goes out of scope.

module

trait Resource {
    def acquire -> This.Maybe { this }
    def release -> Maybe
}

end
